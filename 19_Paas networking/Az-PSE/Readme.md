# Project Azure PSE Architecture
that project include a fully private service endpoint architecture. The whole infrastructure is fully automated (IasC) with powershell.

## Getting Started
In that instructions you will be able to implement and understand the Azure private service endpoint architecture.

### Prerequisites
The script and architecture had the following prerequisites:

* An active Azure subscription
* Latest Powershell Az Modules installed
* Latest Powershell AzureRM.Profile installed
* Owner permission in your Azure Subscription

### Installation
All prerequisits are in place, so we can start with the implementation.

Please start the script.
First you have to insert the required admin account and password for your Azure SQL Database.
The input looks like:

    #######################################################################
    Windows PowerShell credential request.
    Please enter sql server credential
    User: sampleuser
    Password for user sampleuser: ************
    #######################################################################

Okay after that, you have to login into your Azure Tenant. Important, you need an active subscription and Owner permission.

When the login was successfull and you have more than one subscription bound, you have to select the right one.
The output looks like:

    #######################################################################
    There are more subscription available:
    0: Microsoft Azure Subs1
    1: Microsoft Azure Subs2
    Please select the right subscription (insert the number)
